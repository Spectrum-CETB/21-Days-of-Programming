DAY 19:
Find the probability of a perfect square occuring when a number is randomly choosen between numbers a and b over n iterations.

Details:
Given 2 numbers, a and b, you have to find that, over n iterations,
what is the probability that if a number is picked randomly in between a and b, it turns out to be a perfect square.

Inputs:
Input numbers a, b and n.

Outputs:
Print the probability in decimal

Sample:

Inputs
1
100
10
Outputs:
 The output can be anything between 0.00 to 1.00
Given our cases, saying we have 10 perfect squares (1, 4, 9,16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100), 
probability could be around 0.1 optimally, but it can vary in the above range.
