DAY 20:

Write a program to find the number of possible combinations of the elements in an array,without repetition, 
 such that their sum is always lesser than or equal to a number x. 

Details:
Given an array of n number of elements, find all the possible combinations of the elements of an array, 
which on being added, shall result in a sum less than or equal to x.

Inputs:
l = length of the array
a = array elements separated by a space
x = the number which shall act as the condition

Outputs:
Number of such possible combinations. 
If no such combinations are possible, print -1

Sample:
Input:
5
1 3 2 8 4
7
Output:
12

Explanation:
Possible  correct combinations are
3,
2,
4,
1, 
1+3 = 4, 
1+2 = 3, 
1+4 = 5
1+3+2  = 6, 
1+2+4 = 7,
2+4 = 6, 
3+4 = 7,
2+3 = 5

Rest combinations, ilke 1+3+2+4 or 1+3+8+2 result in a sum more than 7. So they arenâ€™t counted.
