DAY 21:

Write a program to find the minimum steps to achieve a particular quantity of chemical using beaker with not measurements.

Details:
You have beakers of X and Y ml(Y>X). Both the beakers can measure only X and Y ml, no smaller quantities. 
You have to collect F quantity using beaker X and Y only for your chemical reaction for F < Y.

Inputs:
Input any two beaker size. (X and Y)
Input the required quantity. (F)

Outputs:
Print the steps (quantity in X and Y beaker at every stage) till one shows the F quantity.

Sample:
Inputs
4 9
6

Outputs:
(0, 0) (0, 9) (4, 5) (0, 5) (4, 1) (0, 1) (1, 9) (4, 6) (0, 6)

Explanation:
Consider 2 beakers one 4ml and other 9ml: Beaker 1 (4ml) and Beaker 2 (9ml)
First fill the 9ml beaker fully. : 0 ml and 9 ml
Pour the chemical into 4ml beaker. : 4 ml and 5 ml
Empty the 4ml beaker. : 0 ml and 5 ml
Repeat this twice. : 4 ml and 1 ml
Now you will left with 1ml chemical in the 9ml beaker: 0 ml and 1 ml
Now pour this 1ml into the 4ml beaker: 1 ml and 0 ml
Refill the 9ml beaker. : 1ml and 9ml
Now pour the chemical from 9ml into the 4ml beaker until it fills up. : 4 ml and 6 ml
Now you are left with 6 ml chemical in the 9ml beaker.
