DAY 17:
Write a program which uses a recursive function to print a Fibonacci series.

Details:
The program will use a recursive function to print the Fibonacci series. The function will have the following parameters as input:-
a-     First element of the series
b-     Second element of the series
n-     number of elements of the series you wanna display
The program should take user input of the above parameters and pass it to the function for execution.

Inputs:
Input the starting element a, second element b, and the number of the elements you wanna display.

Outputs:
Print the series till the nth element.
